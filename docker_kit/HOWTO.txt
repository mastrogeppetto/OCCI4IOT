- Download the OCCI4IOT repo
- cd into the repo
- take a note of the local docker0 IP address (e.g. 172.17.0.1)
- take a note of the remote arduino NTC device (e.g. 192.168.5.177)
- update the ENV definitions in the Dockerfile:
  SINK is the local docker0 address
  NTC is the arduino device
- launch the bogus_sensor with
  $ gunicorn -k flask_sockets.worker -b 0.0.0.0 bogus_sensor:app
- reset the Arduino NTC device
- open another terminal in the same repo directory
- build	and run the docker (occi4iot is an arbitrary name)
  $ docker build -t occi4iot .
  $ docker run -t occi4iot

If you modify any file in the OCCI4IOT directory you need to repeat the build and run steps.
